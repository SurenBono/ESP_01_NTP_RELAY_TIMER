# ESP_01_NTP_RELAY_TIMER
Fan Control for overheating Renewable Energy Harverster

- Automated external Fan control powered by regulated 12dcv paralled on 36dcv 72 cell Solar panels.
- Controls overheating stalling GTB-600 Micro Inverters near Earth Equatorial coordinate on Solar peak hours.
- Simple coding made for ESP_01 Relays initially tested on Mini 12dcv Pc Fan & breadbord .
- Code retrieve NTP Time and converts to local time and utilsed for relay switchimng to tackle Hot climates.
- The modules (MCU ,Fan & Relay ) are planned to run solely on regulated harvested energy.
